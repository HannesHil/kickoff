# A simple and uncomplicated program launcher for wayland

Kickoff is heavily inspired by rofi, but not without changes made.
Like many programs, kickoff was born from an itch that no existing program seemed to relieve and my desire to learn a lower level programming language.

## How does it search
At the moment the path is read and non-recursively filtered for executable files. Other locations are still up for discussion.

## State
This project is still in heavy development and code quality as well as test coverage are in dire need of improvement. But it is usable and I will try not to break *too* much between releases ;-)

## Features
* Wayland compatible (only wlroots based compositors though)
* Fuzzy search
* Fast and snappy (hopefully, improvements planned)
* Remembers often used applications
* Argument support for launched programs

## Roadmap (very incomplete and in no special order)
* Paste support
* UX improvements
* Extended configurability
* Testing and documentation
