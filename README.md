# A simple and uncomplicated program launcher for wayland

Kickoff is heavily inspired from rofi, but not without changes made.
Like many programs, kickoff was born from an itch that no existing program seemed to relieve and my desire to learn a lower level programming language.

## State
This project is still in heavy development and the code quality and test coverage is in dire need of improvement. But it is usable and I will try not to brake *too* much in releases ;-)

## Features
* Wayland compatible (only wlroots based compositors though)
* Fuzzy search
* Fast and snappy (hopefully, improvements planned)
* Remembers often used applications
* Argument support for launched programs

## Roadmap (very incomplete and in no special order)
* Paste support
* UX improvements
* Extended configurability
* Testing and documentation
